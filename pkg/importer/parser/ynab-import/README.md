# YNAB Import

The YNAB import format is a comma-separated CSV with the following columns:

- Date
- Payee
- Memo
- Outflow
- Inflow

You can use [YNAP](https://github.com/leolabs/you-need-a-parser) to parse many different bank export formats into the YNAB import format and then import them into Envelope Zero.
