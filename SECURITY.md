# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please _do not_ open an issue if you find a vulnerability. Send an email to security@envelope-zero.org and a maintainer will get in touch with you.
Please note that this project is maintained by volunteers and therefore, an answer might take some time.

Please provide at least the following information in your report:

- A description of the vulnerability and its impact
- How to reproduce the issue

This project is maintained by a team of volunteers on a reasonable-effort basis. As such, please give us at least 90 days to work on a fix before public exposure.
